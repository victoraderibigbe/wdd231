            <h2>1. Site Name</h2>
            <div class="site-name">
                <strong>CanvasNova</strong>
                <p>
                    This name was selected because it combines "Canvas", symbolizing the medium of artistic expression,
                    with "Nova", a term that represents a new star or a brilliant burst of light. CanvasNova captures
                    the idea of new and rising creativityâ€”a platform where emerging artists can shine and showcase their
                    work to the world. The name conveys inspiration, innovation, and a fresh beginning in the art world.
                    It's memorable, artistic, and clearly communicates the site's purpose of spotlighting talented local
                    creators.

            <h2>2. Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>CanvasNova serves as a comprehensive platform for discovering and connecting with emerging local artists
                across various creative mediums. The site provides a curated digital gallery that showcases artworks
                from local talent, including digital art, acrylic paintings, photography, and sculpture. Visitors can
                explore artist profiles, view high-quality artwork thumbnails, filter content by artistic medium, and
                access detailed information about each artist's background and creative process.</p>
            <p>The platform bridges the gap between local artists seeking exposure and art enthusiasts looking to
                discover fresh, authentic talent in their community. Additionally, the site facilitates direct
                communication through a contact form, enabling potential collaborations, art submissions, and inquiries
                about purchasing or commissioning artwork.</p>
